    For marine state parks, instead of an annual discover pass, an annual moorage pass is your pass 
    to use the state park docks or buoys. Fees are due year 
    round for moorage at docks, floats, & buoys for use
      Users have about 30 minutes to submit payment upon arrival but that is up to the ranger.
      The annual moorage pass and discovery pass are not interchangable.
      All use of washington state parks facilities require fee payments. These payments support
      ongoing parks projects, seasonal staff, and amenities provided at parks.
      Mooring buoys are first come first serve and $15 - it is always a good idea to ensure the buoy 
      is holding your vessel as intended. You are responsible for your vessel. If you 
    decide to pay per use the <emp>offical</emp> current rates and fees can be found

      Marine state parks are remote and require advanced planning to have an enjoyable trip.
      These parks have composting toilets, execpt for those islands which have ferry services.
      These are serviced islands 
      This means the majority of the marine state parks do not have flush toilets or running water.
